Project One: Infernal Festival Website
======================================
**Author:** *Tyler Worth*

# Project Description

Festival is a dynamic and interactive website designed to simulate the experience of an exciting design and experience of visiting and interacting with informaton in the promotional buildup for a hypothetical live festival event.
The Infernal Festival website hosts an engaging interface and vibrant design inspired by the metal music genre and industry trends featured by companies such as Metal Hammer Magazine and Download Festival.

# Website Purpose

The purpose of the Infernal Festival website for visitors is to share information for the (hypothetical) Infernal Festival event, view upcoming lineups of performing artists, receive purchasing and contact information and view visual collections of photography from previous events in addition to answering some user story generated frequently asked questions about the event and its proceedings for participation.

For the Infernal Festival clients themselves the website features strong call to actions toward ticket sales and customer information to repeatedly direct them back to the tickets purchasing page in addition to advertising the event itself and answering customer's frequently asked questions that may help them decide to attend the festival and purchase a ticket.

# Features

Interactive UI: An engaging user interface with smooth scrolling and easy navigation.
Responsive Design: The website design is optimised for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
Ticket contact Form: Ahead of a ticket purchasing system, the website features a contact form for details on ticket purchasing and camping information as its minimum viable product (see MVP section)

# Technologies Used

HTML5: For the structure and content of the website.
CSS3: For styling the site with custom layouts and designs.
Git: Version control to manage project files.
GitHub Pages: Hosting the live version of the project.
RealVisXL v5 Lightning: AI Generation of copyright free images of simulated events and photography.

**Deployment**

This section guides you through the process of deploying your web application to Github Pages from your project repository.

**Pre-requisites:**
- A github account.
- A github repository or clone of with your web project already pushed to it.

***Step 1: Prepare Your Repository***
Check that your project is in a GitHub repository. If you haven't already created one, follow these steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub:
- Go to GitHub and log in.
- Click the + icon at the top-right of the page and select New repository.

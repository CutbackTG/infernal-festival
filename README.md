Project One: Infernal Festival Website
======================================
**Author:** *Tyler Worth*

# Project Description

Festival is a dynamic and interactive website designed to simulate the experience of an exciting design and experience of visiting and interacting with informaton in the promotional buildup for a hypothetical live festival event.
The Infernal Festival website hosts an engaging interface and vibrant design inspired by the metal music genre and industry trends featured by companies such as Metal Hammer Magazine and Download Festival.

# Website Purpose

The purpose of the Infernal Festival website for visitors is to share information for the (hypothetical) Infernal Festival event, view upcoming lineups of performing artists, receive purchasing and contact information and view visual collections of photography from previous events in addition to answering some user story generated frequently asked questions about the event and its proceedings for participation.

For the Infernal Festival clients themselves the website features strong call to actions toward ticket sales and customer information to repeatedly direct them back to the tickets purchasing page in addition to advertising the event itself and answering customer's frequently asked questions that may help them decide to attend the festival and purchase a ticket.

# Features

Interactive UI: An engaging user interface with smooth scrolling and easy navigation.
Responsive Design: The website design is optimised for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
Ticket contact Form: Ahead of a ticket purchasing system, the website features a contact form for details on ticket purchasing and camping information as its minimum viable product (see MVP section)

# Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the structure and content of the website.
- CSS3: For styling the site with custom layouts and designs.
- Git: Version control to manage project files.
- GitHub Pages: Hosting the live version of the project.
- RealVisXL v5 Lightning: AI Generation of copyright free images of simulated events and photography. Engline hosted by https://creator.nightcafe.studio/explore

# Deployment

**Installation**
If youâ€™d like to clone the project and work locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

- Copy
git clone https://github.com/cutbacktg/infernal-festival.git
Navigate to the project directory:

- Copy
cd infernal-festival
Open index.html in a web browser to view the site.

**Deployment**

This section guides you through the process of deploying your web application to Github Pages from your project repository.

**Pre-requisites:**
- A github account.
- A github repository or clone of with your web project already pushed to it.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**
Check that your project is in a GitHub repository. If you haven't already created one, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
- Go to GitHub and log in.
- Click the + icon at the top-right of the page and select New repository.
- Name your repository (e.g., infernal-festival).
- Make sure to initialize the repository with a README file (optional).
- After creating the repository, you will see instructions to push an existing project.

2. Push your local project to Github (if you haven't already done so):
If you have an existing project:
- Open your terminal or command line and navigate to the project folder.

Use the following commands to push your project to Github:

- git init  # If your project isn't already a Git repository
- git add . # Add all files to the staging area
- git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Commit the changes
- git branch -M main  # Rename your default branch to 'main'
- git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/infernal-festival.git  # Replace with your repository URL
- git push -u origin main  # Push to GitHub

**Step 2: Enable Github Pages**

1. Navigate to the settings on your repository page on Github.
- Open the repository on Github.
- Click on the ***settings*** tab located in the top menu of your repository.

2. Find the Github Pages section:
- Scroll down until you find the ***Github Pages*** section under the ***Code and automation*** category.

3. Choose a source branch for deployment:
- In the ***Source*** dropdown, select the branch you want to deploy (usually ***main*** or ***master***)
- After selcting your branch, Github Pages will automatically start building and deploying the website

4. Select the root folder (if necessary):
- Usually the root folder will be enough. However, if you have your site in a specific folder (like ***/docs*** etc), choose that folder instead.
- If your website's ***index.html*** file is in the root of your repository, no folder selection is necessary.

5. Save the changes:
 - After selecting the branch and folder (if applicable), Github will begin deploying your site. This may take several minutes depending upon the size of your site.

 **Step 3: Access your live website**

 Once Github Pages has finished building your site, you can access it via a URL.

 1. Find your Github Pages URL:
 - In the ***Github Pages*** section under ***settings***, you will see a URL that will look like:
 https://yourusername.githuib.io/infernal-festival/ 
 - This URL is your live website (as stated previously this may take a minute or two to appear, simply refresh the page periodically until it appears on the page)
 - Click the link to open your deployed website in your browser.

 **Step 4: Updating your website**

 Any time you make updates or changes to your project (e.g., editing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript), follow these steps to update your live website:

 1. Make changes to your project locally
 - Edit your files as needed in your local project directory as normal.

 2. Commit your changes in your Terminal or command line.
 - git add . (adds all changed files)
 - git commit -m "Update website content" (Commits your changes)

 3. Push the changes to Github:
 - git push origin main (Push to Github main branch)

 4. Wait for Github Pages to rebuild the site:
 - After pushing your changes, Github Pages will automatically rebuild your site with your new content.
 - Refresh the live URL to view your changes.

**Step 5: Troubleshooting**

Site not showing up after deployment?

- Double-check that your index.html file is in the root directory of your repository. GitHub Pages needs this file to display your website.
- Check for typos in your file names or references to other resources (like CSS or JS files).
- Make sure you've committed and pushed all your files to the repository.

Assets (images, CSS, etc.) not loading correctly?

- Ensure the file paths for your assets are correct. GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so make sure file names are properly capitalized.

**Usage**

Once the site is open in your browser, users can:

Browse the site: View the event site, see the band line-up, contact for information on tickets and camping for the event and view the gallery of previous event photography.
